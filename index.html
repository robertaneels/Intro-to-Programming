		        Programming is very literal. You have to tell the computer exactly what to do so that you get the results you want.
		        
		        No doubt this is a challenge because our thought processing in our work and personal lives  use assumptions and skip steps to quickly make decisions and act on them. I look forward to retraining my brain to be more literal, to think and work like a programmer.  Here is what I've learned so far:
		    
		        <p>
		        <a href=""www.udacity.com">HTML</a> is a type of document for web content<br></a>
		        It contains a <em>Title, Header and Body</em> structure
		        </p>
		        </a>The body of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"> HTML document</a><br>
		        is made up of text tht has markup language. This text can be
		        <em> inline </em> or <em>block</em>. <b>Block</b> places a box around the text<br>
		        much like a text box drawn in Word or Power point.</p>

		        <p>
		        <b>Void</b> tags,such as <em>break</em>, do not require closing tags whereas other tags such as 
		        the one used for <em>italics</em> requires a closing tag with an /
		        at the end of the text. If a closing tag is not used where appropriate,<br>
		        then <b>everything after the opening tag will take on the same style or attribute and there will be no terminating point.<br>
		        Like shown here.</b>
		        </p>                            
		       </div>

		</div> 
		<div class = "Lessontext">        
		        <p>Where to begin? I remember most what I learned last and that is <em>"Boxes Boxes Boxes!!!"</em> Breaking down pages into boxes to be identified, sized, and characterized is an important step to web development.</p>
		          
		        <p>Think of HTML as the house or structure, CSS as the styling or decor or architecture of the house, and Java Script as the Interactive components that can change the attributes of the structure.</p>
		        <p><b>DOM</b> is a reference to the Tree Structure of an HTML document. It is hierarchical in nature and HTML creates the elements of the <b>DOM</b>.</p>

		      <p>Contrary to popular opinion <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a> here <b>does not</b> refer to The College of St. Scholastica which is an independent private college based in Duluth, Minnesota with campuses across the state. 
		      What it does refer to however is the styling-- Cascading Stying Sheets-- used to apply to HTML documentation. It uses the concept of <em>inheritance</em> where descendant elements inherit text related properties of ascendant elements. This, however, does not apply with box related properties.</p>
		      <p> CSS allows you to assign attributes to elements of your document in a number of ways. For example by setting font, font size, color, background color, etc. It also allows you to control the size of the boxes in your document.</p>          <p> You can assign those attributes in groups using class selectors such as <div class=h1>. This allows the user to ascribe styling to everying that is in the header elements</p>
		      <p> There are two recommended ways to CSS in your HTML document.                       <ul>
		      <li>Write CSS in the <head> of your HTML                   <li>Link your HTML to a separate CSS file                   </ul>                        
		      <p>Setting box sizes can be tricky. There are two ways to do this.                      <ul>                   <li>Set sizes in terms of percents rather than pixels.           <li>Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element. </ul>                      Divs by default will take up the entire width of the page. Using display: flex; will allow the divs to appear side by side
		      </p>
		      <p>
		       Images should include an alt to describe what should appear if the browser prohibits the image from appearing.</p>       
		</div>                      
		<div class=image>                             <div class ="app.png"><img src="app.png" alt="This         is a screenshot">                         
		
			<p><b>Code, Test, Refine</b> are important steps to creating your web page. Looking for natural boxes, repeated styles and semantic elements, write your HTML and apply styles from biggest to smallest.</p>
			<p> Developer Tools are a nifty way to view you site, code and changes at the same time. Also use these links to verify your page complies with HTML and CSS standards. Click here         <a href=" http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">To verify HTML</a> and here
