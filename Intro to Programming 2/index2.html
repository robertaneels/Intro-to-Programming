		     Programming is very literal. You have to tell the
		     computer exactly what to do so that you get the 
		     results you want.
		      
		     No doubt this is a challenge because our thought
		     processing in our work and personal lives  use 
		     assumptions and skip steps to quickly make decisions
		     and act on them. I look forward to retraining my 
		     brain to be more literal, to think and work like a 
		     programmer.Here is what I've learned so far:
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> 
		    is a type of document for web content.
		    It contains a <em>Title, Header and Body</em> structure.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    The body of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML document</a>
		    is made up of text that has markup language. This text
		    can be
		    <em> inline </em> or <em>block</em>. <b>Block</b> 
		    places a box around the text<br>
		    much like a text box drawn in Word or Power point.
		 	</p>

		    <p>
		    <b>Void</b> tags,such as <em>break</em>, do not 
		    require closing tags whereas other tags such as 
		    the one used for <em>italics</em> requires a closing 
		    tag with an /
		    at the end of the text. If a closing tag is not used 
		    where appropriate,<br>
		    then <b>everything after the opening tag will take on 
		    the same style or attribute and there will be no 
		    terminating point.<br>
		    Like shown here.</b>
		    </p>                            
		</div>

		     <p>Where to begin? I remember most what I learned 
		     	last and that is <em>"Boxes Boxes Boxes!!!"</em> 
		     	Breaking down pages into boxes to be identified, 
		     	sized, and characterized is an important step to
		     	web development.
		     </p>
		          
		     <p>Think of HTML as the house or structure, CSS as
		     the styling or decor or architecture of the house, 
		     and Java Script as the Interactive components that 
		     can change the attributes of the structure.
		     </p>
		     <p><b>DOM</b> is a reference to the Tree Structure of 
		     an HTML document. It is hierarchical in nature and 
		     HTML creates the elements of the <b>DOM</b>.

		     <p>Contrary to popular opinion <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets"
		     	>CSS</a> 
		     	here <b>does not</b> refer to The College of St.
		     	Scholastica which is an independent private college
		     	based in Duluth, Minnesota with campuses across the
		     	 state. 
		     What it does refer to however is the styling-- 
		     Cascading Stying Sheets-- used to apply to HTML 
		     documentation. It uses the concept of <em>inheritance
		     </em> where descendant elements inherit text related
		     properties of ascendant elements. This, however, does
		     not apply with box related properties.
		 	 </p>
		     <p> CSS allows you to assign attributes to elements
		     of your document in a number of ways. For example by 
		     setting font, font size, color, background color, etc. It
		     also allows you to control the size of the boxes in your
		     document.</p>  
		     <p> You can assign those attributes in groups using class 
		     selectors such as "&lt;div class=h1&gt;". This allows the
		     user to ascribe styling to everying that is in the header
		     elements</p>
		     <p> There are two recommended ways to include CSS in your HTML 
		     document.                       
		     <ul>
		     <li>Write CSS in the "&lt;head&gt;" of your 
		     HTML                   
		     <li>Link your HTML to a separate CSS 
		     file                   
		     </ul>
		                            
		     <p>Setting box sizes can be tricky. There are two ways to
		     do this.                      
		     <ul>                   
		     <li>Set sizes in terms of percents rather than pixels. 
		     <li>Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every 
		     element. 
		     </ul> 
		     Divs by default will take up the entire width of the page.
		     Using display: flex; will allow the divs to appear side 
		     by side
		     
		     <p>
		     Images should include an alt to describe what should 
		     appear if the browser prohibits the image from appearing.
		   	 </p> 
		   	 <p><b>Code, Test, Refine</b> are important steps to 
			creating your web page. Looking for natural boxes,
			repeated styles and semantic elements, write your HTML 
			and apply styles from biggest to smallest.</p>

      		<p>Programming is the core of computer science. A computer 
      			can do very powerful and fast computations but it
      			needs a program to tell it what to compute or do. 
      			There are many different languages<br>
        		and they all have an interpreter that follow 
        		instructions in its code in order to tell the computer
        		what to do. This is much like what is taught in Lesson
        		1 but instead using the Python language for teaching 
        		programming. Another theme carried here is that 
        		language ambiguity will result in errors not the
        		computer not producing the desired result.<br>
        	<br>
        		Similarly as learned with HTML and CSS programming, 
        		Python requires a structure. In this lesson the 
        		structure is analogous to sentence structure (Subject-
        		Verb-Noun.) In Python this grammar structure is 
        		represented as Expressions and Operators. Expresion 
        		can be another Expression-Operator-Expression or it 
        		can be a number. It starts from a non-terminal term 
        		and uses derivation to break the structure down to a 
        		terminal value.<br>
        	<br>
        		Also an Expression can be made another expression by
        		using parentheses.

    		<p>Variables and strings allow you to more easily and 
    			cleanly code for searching web documents.
 				<ul>
        		<li><b>Variables</b> are assignments of values to a 
        			name that can be used in Python computing and 
        			allow the value to be changed
        		<li><b>Strings</b> are a sequence of characters that 
        			can be assigned to a variable. Quotations must be 
        			used to define a string
        		<li><b>Indexing Strings</b> enable extracting a 
        			subsequence of a string and the first position or
        			start and stop of the subsequence can be used to
        			extract. Using [0:] for example will display the 
        			entire string
        		<li><b>Find String</b> operation which is represented
        		by string.find(string) provides an output that gives 
        		the position where the substring is found. An output 
        		of -1 means string is not found.
        		<li><b>Finding String in Strings</b> uses the 
        			(subsequence string, number) to provide the start
        			position of searching a target subsequence.

    		<p>Using Procedures is about matching inputs to outputs.
    		To do this you define a function in which parameter(s) is 
    		passed. The parameter is enclosed in parentheses like 
    		"(name)". Once defined, then the function is used to 
    		create the output.<br>
      		"&lt;"div class = example&gt;"
        		def rest_of_string(s):<br>
              	return s[1:]<br>
              	print rest_of_string ('audacity)<br>
              	<em>Output</em> is Udacity
        	 
    		<p>In the above exmample every line starting from def 
    			through return is "Defining" the procedures. The Print
    			line and it's output are the "Use" part of the
    			procedure.<br>    
        	Note that your procedure always needs a return statement
        	to make the function work.</p>    
    		<p>"Procedure Composition" uses outputs from procedures as 
    			inputs to the next procedure.Such as shown here:
    		</p>
			<div class = example>
      			"&lt;div class = example&gt;"   
      			def square(n)<br>
      			return n*n<br>
      			x=5<br>
      			print square(x)<br>  
      			print square(square(x))<br>
      			<em>Output</em> is 1874161<br>

    		<p>This lesson teaches decisions and repetitions using
    		Python. <b>Comparison Operators</b> are one way to do this. 
      			<ul>
        		<li>Less than or Equal to "&lt;&gt;=" 
        		<li>Not Equal to "!="
        		<li>Equality comparsion "==" vs. Assignment "="
      			</ul>
    		         
    		<p>The "Or" operator only evaluates what it needs to. If
    		the first expression evaluates to "True" it will give 
    		"True" and not 
    		evaluate to next expression. Same thing for "False".
    		</p>

    		<p>It is important to note that with only a few operators
    			you can simulate any operation you want: arithmetic, 
    			comparison, procedures, if, etc.</p>    
          
    		<p><b>Loops</b> using a "While" statement allows a test 
    		expression to be checked 
    		multiple times vs. an If statement which only allows once.
    		Let's take a look at an example.</p> 
    	<div class = example>
        def print_numbers(n):<br>
              i=1<br>
              while "i" "&lt;" "n" <em> quotes here only for emphasis
              </em> <br>
              print i<br>
              i=i+1<br>
    	</div>
    	<p>Use "break" statement to breat a loop so that it will not
    	run on indefinitely</p>
    	<div class = "Importanttips">
      	<p>Use "max" in your procedure to identify the larger value.
