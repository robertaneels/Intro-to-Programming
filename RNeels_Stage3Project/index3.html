		     Programming is very literal. You have to tell the
		     computer exactly what to do so that you get the 
		     results you want.
		      
		     No doubt this is a challenge because our thought
		     processing in our work and personal lives  use 
		     assumptions and skip steps to quickly make decisions
		     and act on them. I look forward to retraining my 
		     brain to be more literal, to think and work like a 
		     programmer.Here is what I've learned so far:
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> 
		    is a type of document for web content.
		    It contains a <em>Title, Header and Body</em> structure.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    The body of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML document</a>
		    is made up of text that has markup language. This text
		    can be
		    <em> inline </em> or <em>block</em>. <b>Block</b> 
		    places a box around the text<br>
		    much like a text box drawn in Word or Power point.
		 	</p>
		    <p>
		    <b>Void</b> tags,such as <em>break</em>, do not 
		    require closing tags whereas other tags such as 
		    the one used for <em>italics</em> requires a closing 
		    tag with an /
		    at the end of the text. If a closing tag is not used 
		    where appropriate,<br>
		    then <b>everything after the opening tag will take on 
		    the same style or attribute and there will be no 
		    terminating point.<br>
		    Like shown here.</b>
		    </p>                            
		</div>                         
		<div class="Lesson">
		  <h1>Stage 1 Make Your Web Page: Lesson 2 Notes</h1>

		</div> 
		<div class = "Lessontext">   
		     <p>Where to begin? I remember most what I learned 
		     	last and that is <em>"Boxes Boxes Boxes!!!"</em> 
		     	Breaking down pages into boxes to be identified, 
		     	sized, and characterized is an important step to
		     	web development.
		     </p>
		          
		     <p>Think of HTML as the house or structure, CSS as
		     the styling or decor or architecture of the house, 
		     and Java Script as the Interactive components that 
		     can change the attributes of the structure.
		     </p>
		     <p><b>DOM</b> is a reference to the Tree Structure of 
		     an HTML document. It is hierarchical in nature and 
		     HTML creates the elements of the <b>DOM</b>.
		     </p>

		  <h1>Stage 1 Make Your Web Page: Lesson 3 Notes</h1>

		 <div class = "Lessontext">           
		     <p>Contrary to popular opinion <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a> 
		     	here <b>does not</b> refer to The College of St.
		     	Scholastica which is an independent private college
		     	based in Duluth, Minnesota with campuses across the
		     	state. 
		     What it does refer to however is the styling-- 
		     Cascading Stying Sheets-- used to apply to HTML 
		     documentation. It uses the concept of <em>inheritance
		     </em> where descendant elements inherit text related
		     properties of ascendant elements. This, however, does
		     not apply with box related properties.
		 	 </p>
		     <p> CSS allows you to assign attributes to elements
		     of your document in a number of ways. For example by 
		     setting font, font size, color, background color, etc. 
		     It
		     also allows you to control the size of the boxes in your
		     document.</p>  
		     <p> You can assign those attributes in groups using 
		     	class 
		     selectors such as "&lt;div class=h1&gt;". This allows 
		     the
		     user to ascribe styling to everying that is in the 
		     header
		     elements</p>
		     <p> There are two recommended ways to include CSS in 
		     	your HTML 
		     document.                       
		     <ul>
		     <li>Write CSS in the "&lt;head&gt;" of your 
		     HTML                   
		     <li>Link your HTML to a separate CSS 
		     file                   
		     </ul>                     
		     <p>Setting box sizes can be tricky. There are two ways 
		     to
		     do this.                      
		     <ul>                   
		     <li>Set sizes in terms of percents rather than pixels. 
		     <li>Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for 
		     every element. 
		     </ul> 
		     Divs by default will take up the entire width of the 
		     page.
		     Using display: flex; will allow the divs to appear side 
		     by side
		     <p>
		     Images should include an alt to describe what should 
		     appear if the browser prohibits the image from appearing
		     .
		   	 </p> 
		   	 <p><b>Code, Test, Refine</b> are important steps to 
			creating your web page. Looking for natural boxes,
			repeated styles and semantic elements, write your HTML 
			and apply styles from biggest to smallest.</p>
			<p>It is also important to avoid repetition by using CSS.
			 This is achieved by using CSS styles to apply to 
			 sections throughout the document such as title, header,
			 and text. This ensures document consistency and allows 
			 you to easily add to or update HTML without 
			 repetitively ascribing specific attributes throughout 
			 the document</p>
			<p> Developer Tools are a nifty way to view you site, 
			code and changes at the same time. Also use these 
			links to verify your page complies with HTML and CSS 
			standards.Click here

      		<p>Programming is the core of computer science. A 
      			computer 
      			can do very powerful and fast computations but it
      			needs a program to tell it what to compute or do. 
      			There are many different languages<br>
        		and they all have an interpreter that follow 
        		instructions in its code in order to tell the 
        		computer
        		what to do. This is much like what is taught in 
        		Lesson
        		1 but instead using the Python language for teaching 
        		programming. Another theme carried here is that 
        		language ambiguity will result in errors not the
        		computer not producing the desired result.<br>
        	<br>
        		Similarly as learned with HTML and CSS programming, 
        		Python requires a structure. In this lesson the 
        		structure is analogous to sentence structure (Subject
        		-
        		Verb-Noun.) In Python this grammar structure is 
        		represented as Expressions and Operators. Expresion 
        		can be another Expression-Operator-Expression or it 
        		can be a number. It starts from a non-terminal term 
        		and uses derivation to break the structure down to a 
        		terminal value.<br>
        	<br>
        		Also an Expression can be made another expression by
        		using parentheses.

    		<p>Variables and strings allow you to more easily and 
    			cleanly code for searching web documents.
 				<ul>
        		<li><b>Variables</b> are assignments of values to a 
        			name that can be used in Python computing and 
        			allow the value to be changed
        		<li><b>Strings</b> are a sequence of characters that 
        			can be assigned to a variable. Quotations must 
        			be 
        			used to define a string
        		<li><b>Indexing Strings</b> enable extracting a 
        			subsequence of a string and the first position or
        			start and stop of the subsequence can be used to
        			extract. Using [0:] for example will display the 
        			entire string
        		<li><b>Find String</b> operation which is represented
        		by string.find(string) provides an output that gives 
        		the position where the substring is found. An output 
        		of -1 means string is not found.
        		<li><b>Finding String in Strings</b> uses the 
        			(subsequence string, number) to provide the start
        			position of searching a target subsequence.

    		<p>Using Procedures is about matching inputs to outputs.
    		To do this you define a function in which parameter(s)
    		 is 
    		passed. The parameter is enclosed in parentheses like 
    		"(name)". Once defined, then the function is used to 
    		create the output.<br>
      		"&lt;"div class = example&gt;"
        		def rest_of_string(s):<br>
              	return s[1:]<br>
              	print rest_of_string ('audacity)<br>
              	<em>Output</em> is Udacity
        	 
    		<p>In the above exmample every line starting from def 
    			through return is "Defining" the procedures. The
    			 Print
    			line and it's output are the "Use" part of the
    			procedure.<br>    
        	Note that your procedure always needs a return statement
        	to make the function work.</p>    
    		<p>"Procedure Composition" uses outputs from procedures 
    			as 
    			inputs to the next procedure.Such as shown here:
    		</p>
			<div class = "example">
      			"&lt;div class = example&gt;"

      			return n*n<br>
      			x=5<br>
      			print square(x)<br>

    		<p>This lesson teaches decisions and repetitions using
    		Python. <b>Comparison Operators</b> are one way to do
    		this.</p>
      			<ul>
        		<li>Less than or Equal to "&lt;&gt;=" 
        		<li>Not Equal to "!="
        		<li>Equality comparsion "==" vs. Assignment "="
      			</ul>
      		       
    		<p>The "Or" operator only evaluates what it needs to. If
    		the first expression evaluates to "True" it will give 
    		"True" and not 
    		evaluate to next expression. Same thing for "False".
    		</p>

    		<p>It is important to note that with only a few operators
    			you can simulate any operation you want: arithmetic, 
    			comparison, procedures, if, etc.</p>    
          
    		<p><b>Loops</b> using a "While" statement allows a test 
    		expression to be checked 
    		multiple times vs. an If statement which only allows once
    		.
    		Let's take a look at an example.</p> 
    	<div class = "example">

			<h1>Stage 3: Lesson 0 Notes - "Power of Abstraction"</h1>
 		</div>   
 		<div class = "Lessontext">
 		<p> Hiding detail in programming is called 
 		<em>Abstraction</em>. 
 		This is seen in functions such as "Print" Hello World or 
 		using 
 		"webbrowser.open" to open a link. "If Statements", "Loops" 
 		and 
 		"Functions" are other functions that demonstrate Abstraction.
 		This lesson covers Abstraction
 		as well as Classes and Object oriented programming.  
		</div>
		<div class="Lesson">
			<h1>Stage 3 Add Videos to Your Page: Lesson 1</h1>
 		</div>   
 		<div class = "Lessontext">
 		<p> This lesson uses 2 projects to learn using functions. The
 		best technique When you go about building a program is to 
 		first 
 		write in plain english what steps you would take to get to 
 		the 
 		end result. As an example</P>
 		<div class ="example">
 			<ul>
 			<li>wait for 2 hours<br>
 			<li>open browser<br>
 			<li>repeat steps 3 times<br>
 			</ul>
 		</div>
 		<p> IDLE and Python shell allows you to build your python 
 			code 
 			and run it to see the output. For the first project in 
 			this 
 			lesson, we created code to open a site using webbrowser.
 			open.
 			This is a function in the python library. "Import
 			webbrowser" in your python code will import the 
 			webbrowser
 			function. "Import time" imports a library that includes 
 			the
 			fuction time.sleep. This lets you incorporate a delay in 
 			seconds to running the next function. In this case, the
 			webbrowser.</p>
 		<p> Python Standard library has modules that include 
 			functions
 		    defined inside of it, such as "time" which includes def 
 		    ctime, def sleep.</p>
 		  <p>"Abstraction" allows us to focus on 
 		    the 
 		    program we want to create and the hiding of detail behind the functions in computer 
 			science is
 			called "Abstraction". 
 		<p> Functions can help make things easier We can read 
 		    documentation the about
 		    libraries to find out what the functions inside 
 		    them 
 		    will do
 		    and see how they help us create our code. . For the
 		    2nd project to decode a message, "import OS" or 
 		    "import os.path". 
 			Steps
 			to take to rename a bunch of files would be:
 			<ul>
 			<li><em>get all the file names</em>
 			<li><em>for each file, rename it</em>
 			</ul>
 		<p> Again because we are using a library in Python, we 
 			can scan
 			documentation for that library to find the appropriate 
 			function for renaming a file. In this case, 
 			<b>os.rename</b>
 			which lets you take
 			the existing file name and identify the new 
 			corresponding 
 			file name.</p>
 			<p> "os.getcwd" and "os.chdir" allow you to hone in on the 
 			file
 			location and reset the directory once the program is run.
 			</p>
 		<p>	If condition is incorrect, program will return an error 
 			which
 			we call an "Exception".</p>
 		<p>"OS" module in python has "listdir" and "rename" functions. 
 		</p>
 		<p> Start by creating a new python file, add functions 
 			writing
 			code one line at a time. </p>
		</div>     
		<div class="Lesson">
			<h1>Stage 3 Add Videos to Your Page: Lesson 2</h1>
 		</div>   
 		<div class = "Lessontext">
 		<p> This lesson teaches use of <b>Classes</b> by introducing 
 			"turtle" to create shapes. When you import a <b>Class</b>
 			 in
 			Python like turtle, it's like retrieving the blueprint
 			of a 
 			building that provides information about its structure 
 			like 
 			size, dimensions, rooms, levels, etc. </p>
 		<p> Within a Class you are able to use or create 
 			"Instances" 
 			or
 		 	"Objects". This would be like creating multiple
 		 	blueprints 
 		 	for the same building but it has a unique name or 
 		 	identifier.
 		 	Let's take a look at an example.</p> 
    	<div class = "example">
        	This python file contains code that imports the 
        	Class of
        	turtle, and creates instances called "Brad", 
        	"Angie", 
        	"Marge" and "Ken" and 
        	others to initialize memory to perform certain 
        	functions. 
        	"Brad and Angie" are used to tell the code to move 
        	lines 
        	certain directions and patterns.</div>
        	
    		<p>"Twillio" is another good example where Class is used. 
    		It is one of thousands of external Python packages or 
    		modules and specifically allows you to send text messages.
    		</p>
    	<div class = "example">
    		from twilio.rest import TwilioRestClient
    	</div>
			<p>Python keyword "from" allows you to import
			specific 
			attributes from a module into the current name space
			. 
			Similarly you are able to initialize and create 
			objects or 
			instances of the TwilioRestClient to send text 
			messages.
		</p>
		<p> Again we can see how the use of Class and Instance
		 	in Python is very similar to HTML and CSS. HTML 
		 	creates the DOM or structure of the document, much
		 	 like Class has the blueprint for a structue or 
		 	 building. The functions within both are used to 
		 	 create or build the instances of their structures.
		 	 Attributes of the structures such as width, 
		 	 height, color, texture, length, etc are assigned 
		 	 using the functions and in the case of HTML these
		 	 are propagated by use of the functions in CSS. 
		 	 Again the "Abstraction" is the behind the scenes 
		 	 programming of the functions that create Classes 
		 	 and Instances, and similarly HTML and CSS files.
		</p>
		<p> Also addressed in the Lesson 2 series are "Built in 
			Functions" in Python, such as <b>Open</b> which
			returns the "object" of the file type.
			<div class = "example">
			quotes = open (file_location)<br>
			Here Open is calling some type of init function
		</div>	
		<p>	Another example of built-in functions is with "urllib"  
			which is a module in python that helps connect to the
			internet to get info. "urlopen" is similar in that it 
			opens connections to the website on the internet and 
			perform
			certain actions. </p>
		<div class = "example">
			def check_profanity(text_to_check):<br>
    		connection = urllib.urlopen("http://www.wdyl.<br>
    		com/profanity?q="+text_to_check)<br>
    		output = connection.read()<br>
    	</div>
    	<p>	This is part of python code to build an profanity editor
    	 that looks for indecent language within a movie 
    	 titles/descriptions. So urllib is a module in python.
    	 Urlopen is a function inside of it.
 		</p>

		<div class="Lesson">
			<h1>Stage 3 Add Videos to Your Page: Lesson 3</h1>
 		</div>   
 		<div class = "Lessontext">
 		<p> Here we learn how to build our own Class, such as the 
 			class 
 			Movie. So like a blueprint think of things you want to 
 			know 
 			about that particular structure and list them. In the 
 			case 
 			of the class Movie we noted: title, youtube trailer, 
 			reviews, poster image, and storyline. </p>
 		<p> <b>Class variables</b> are instances in a class that 
 			share these 
 			variables to determine their attribute. 
 			There are built in class attributes such as "__doc__".
 		<p><b>Constructor</b> is the thing behind an instance 	or 
 			"Init" function that allows you to call on it to do some 
 			kind of action.
 		<p><b>Instance Method</b> are functions inside a Class that 
 			allow you to create instances of a class by using the 
 			"self"
 			parameter. "self" points to the object or instance, such 
 			as 
 			"Avator" or "Toy_Story". Behind the scenes it sets aside 
 			memory for an instance with its own variables called <b> 
 			Instance Variables </b>
 		<p><b>Inheritance</b> is the concept used with Parent/Child 
 			relationships where attributes are carried from Class to
 			 each of its Instances.  
		<div class = "Importanttips">
      		<p>Good to Know! If you Google Python Style Guide,
      		 you'll 
      		find conventions on how to write programs.
    		</p>
		</div>
		<p> So to tie this all together-- Stage 3 focuses on 
			the use of Object Oriented Programming in Python or
			OOP. OOP in Python is based on use of Classes.
			Classes are used which contain attributes 
			and methods to create "objects" or 
			instances of itself. I've read a good analogy 
			to Class being a recipe. It contains the 
			ingredients and instructions for creating, say, 
			cupcakes. The type of cupcakes you make from 
			the recipe, i.e., instances, depend on the 
			ingredients in the recipe  
			and how it directs you to 
			make the batch of cupcakes. What the cupcakes 
			are made of are the "abstract" characteristics
			of the recipe. They could be chocolate or 
			filled with fruit preserves or size extra large 
			depending on the attributes assigned to a 
			particular batch. 
		</p>
			We can also see how Object Oriented Programming
			 applies with use of HTML and CSS. HTML has a 
			 structure or "recipe guidelines" like Class that 
			 define the structure of the HTML document.
			 Functions used in HTML use abstraction to define 
			 characteristics within the structure such as using
			  "div" to create boxes. Then CSS assigns 
			  attributes of styling to the structure like "div 
			  class" to define the color, sizing, etc. of the 
			  div box. Or in our analogy, assigns the size of 
			  the pan or type of flavoring to use as examples
			   when making instances of that HTML structure.  
		<p>	We also know that Classes allow for avoiding 	
			repetition, much like CSS. The attributes of the 
			Class can be "inherited" by the instance or object 
			of the class so that the programmer does not have
